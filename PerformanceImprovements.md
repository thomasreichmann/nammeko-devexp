# Performance Improvements Documentation

## Overview

During extended testing periods, a noticeable degradation in performance was observed, particularly with the `list_orders` call. This degradation is attributed to the increasing volume of orders returned by the `list_orders` call over time, as new orders are continuously added by the performance tests.

## Solutions Implemented

### Pagination for List Orders

To address the performance issues with the `list_orders` call, a pagination system was implemented. This system limits the number of orders processed and returned in each request, thereby handling a smaller, more manageable amount of data. This approach significantly reduces the load on the system, leading to more consistent performance, even as the total number of orders grows over time.

### Optimizing Product Details Retrieval in Order Processing

Another key area of performance improvement was in the order processing workflow, specifically in how product details were retrieved and processed. The original implementation fetched the details of all products for each order processing request, which became increasingly inefficient as the number of products grew.

#### Changes Made:

1. **New RPC Method for Product Retrieval**: A new RPC method, `get_products_by_ids`, was introduced in the products service. This method allows for fetching details of a specific set of products based on their IDs. This targeted approach is more efficient than retrieving all products, especially when the total number of products is large.

2. **Updated FastAPI Service**: The FastAPI service was updated to utilize the new `get_products_by_ids` method. When processing orders, the service now extracts the product IDs from the order details and fetches only the relevant product information. This significantly reduces the data processing and network overhead, as only necessary product details are retrieved.

3. **Maintaining Functional Integrity**: While optimizing the retrieval of product details, care was taken to ensure that all original functionalities, such as the inclusion of product information and image URLs in the order details, were maintained.

### Impact

These improvements have led to a noticeable enhancement in the system's performance. The pagination system effectively manages the data load in the `list_orders` call, while the optimized product details retrieval process reduces the latency and resource usage in the order processing workflow. Together, these changes contribute to a more scalable and efficient system, capable of maintaining performance levels even under increased load.
